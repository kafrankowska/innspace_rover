# Innspace Rover Autonomous Navigation System
---
This is a Innspace Rover Autonomous Navigation System implemented in ROS2 Humble. Workspace contains set of packages that enable to simulate, test, use and integrate systems required for autonomous navigation tasks.

3. Usage guide

### 1. Installation
---
Run set of commands in your terminal:
1. Create workdir and src folder
<pre><code>mkdir innspace_rover
</code></pre>

2. Clone the repository 
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:kafrankowska/innspace_rover.git
rosdep install --from-paths src -r -y
colcon build --symlink-install
</code></pre>

3. Launch simulation
<pre><code>source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch rover_description launch_sim.launch.py
</code></pre>

### 2. System description
---
> Packages list: 
> 
> - __rover_description__ - package containing rover description
>  - __rover_simulation__ - package responsible for defining simulation enviroment
>  - __rover_localization__ - package meant to integrate rover's odometry system. It fuses information coming from wheel encoders, IMU and GPS and it publishes smooth Odometry frames with <mark>odom</mark> which is transfered to <mark>base_link</mark>


### rover_description
---

This package aims to declare robot structure, sensors, and driver controller in order to simulate robot behaviour in Gazebo and/or RVIZ.

Rover is equipped with OAK-D lite stereo camera and IMU system. Rover description  assumes differential drive controller which can be handeled with twist teleoperation.

 For keyboard teleop type in terminal: 
 <pre><code>
 ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r /cmd_vel:=/diff_cont/cmd_vel_unstamped
 </code></pre>


### rover_simulation
---

Rover simulation package is responsible for launching different declared gazebo simulations enviroments. Rover_description package is mandatory for simulation. User is able to check performance of rover's systems and implemented algorithms.

Package contains following worlds scenarios:
> - __ERC 2022 Marsyard World__ - 3D enviroment model provided by ERC organizators

### rover_localization
---
Package provides smooth and accurate odometry information based on fused sensor information from the data provided by wheel encoders and IMU platform. through geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped and geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovarianceStamped. 

Package uses  Extended Kalman filter state stmiator to implement fusion. 

Future release shall increase functionality with navsat_transform_node which transforms geographic coordinates into the robotâ€™s world frame  that enables working with GPS systems.
